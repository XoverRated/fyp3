```

### Frontend Application
```typescript
- Web3Context: Centralized blockchain interaction layer

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Safe state management
- **Event Logging**: Complete audit trail

### Frontend Security
- **MetaMask Authentication**: Secure wallet-based user authentication
- **Transaction Verification**: Client-side validation before signing
- **Network Validation**: Ensures connection to correct blockchain
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management and user feedback

## üìä Functional Capabilities

### For Voters
1. **Connect Wallet**: One-click MetaMask connection
2. **View Proposals**: Browse all available voting proposals
3. **Cast Votes**: Secure yes/no voting with MetaMask confirmation
4. **Track Status**: Real-time voting status and results
5. **Verify Transactions**: Blockchain transaction hash for each vote

### For Administrators
1. **Create Proposals**: Add new voting proposals with custom duration
2. **Authorize Voters**: Grant voting rights to specific addresses
3. **Manage Voting**: Monitor and control the voting process
4. **View Analytics**: Track proposal performance and participation

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Functions
```solidity
createProposal(title, description, duration) ‚Üí Creates new voting proposal
vote(proposalId, choice, ipfsHash) ‚Üí Casts vote with verification
authorizeVoter(address) ‚Üí Grants voting rights
getProposal(proposalId) ‚Üí Retrieves proposal details
getAllProposals() ‚Üí Lists all proposals
hasVoted(proposalId, voter) ‚Üí Checks voting status
```

### Web3 Integration
```typescript
- Ethers.js for blockchain interaction
- MetaMask provider integration
- Real-time blockchain state monitoring
- Transaction receipt handling
- Event listening and processing
```

### Data Flow
1. **User Action**: User initiates vote through UI
2. **MetaMask Prompt**: Transaction signing request
3. **Blockchain Transaction**: Vote recorded on Ethereum
4. **Event Emission**: Smart contract emits VoteCast event
5. **UI Update**: Real-time interface updates with new vote
